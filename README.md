# PlagCheck : A Document Similarity Application

## Introduction
Document Matching using Dynamic Programming project is a Swift implementation of a document matching algorithm that uses dynamic programming to compare two documents and return the matched characters. The algorithm uses a tabulation approach to store previously seen values, which improves the average run time efficiency to O(n*m), where n and m represent the sizes of two documents being compared in a document matching problem.
