## Introduction
Imagine you have two documents, Document A and Document B, and you want to determine their similarity. Document Matching using Dynamic Programming can help by calculating the length of the longest common subsequence between the two documents. This length can be used as a measure of similarity, with a higher length indicating a higher degree of similarity. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n*m), making it efficient for large documents.

## About the Algorithm
Dynamic programming is a method used in computer science to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. By solving each subproblem only once and storing the results, it avoids redundant computations, leading to more efficient solutions for a wide range of problems. In the context of document matching, dynamic programming can be used to calculate the length of the longest common subsequence between two documents, which can be used as a measure of similarity.
